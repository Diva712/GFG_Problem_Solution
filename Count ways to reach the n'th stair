There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. Count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

Example 1:

Input:
n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation:
You can reach 4th stair in 5 ways. 
Way 1: Climb 2 stairs at a time. 
Way 2: Climb 1 stair at a time.
Way 3: Climb 2 stairs, then 1 stair
and then 1 stair.
Way 4: Climb 1 stair, then 2 stairs
then 1 stair.
Way 5: Climb 1 stair, then 1 stair and
then 2 stairs.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 10
Output: 89 
Explanation: 
There are 89 ways to reach the 10th stair.
Your Task:
Complete the function countWays() which takes the top stair number m as input parameters and returns the answer % 10^9+7.
