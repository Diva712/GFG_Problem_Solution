Given an array arr[] of N non-negative integers representing the height of blocks. If width of each block is 1, compute how much water can be trapped between the blocks during the rainy season. 
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
arr[] = {3,0,0,2,0,4}
Output:
10
Explanation: 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {7,4,0,9}
Output:
10
Explanation:
Water trapped by above 
block of height 4 is 3 units and above 
block of height 0 is 7 units. So, the 
total unit of water trapped is 10 units.
Example 3:

Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {6,9,9}
Output:
0
Explanation:
No water will be trapped.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. The task is to complete the function trappingWater() which takes arr[] and N as input parameters and returns the total amount of water that can be trapped.
